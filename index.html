    <p>My name is Ashley and I am a student of the UT Austin Data 
    Analytics Bootcamp. I am currently working on a project to 
    learn HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I hope to use the skills 
    I have learned in this bootcamp to help with my career as a 
    product manager in data engineering. </p>
    <p>I was a project/program manager for 4.5 years before I became
    a product manager. I have been a product manager for 3 months. I 
    focus on data infrastructure and data engineering or business intelligence
    products. I am currently learning more about cloud infrastructure and
    working with my teams to incorporate it into our workflows. </p>
    <p>You can find me at the following social media pages:
